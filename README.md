# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns.
In this project we are helping Louise to uncover trends and ways to make a successful crowdfunding.

## Data Resume
In the Analysis we could find that the most successful crowdfundings are the ones destinated to Theater, specially, plays.

## Final Recommendations

The most supported campaingns were the ones that were launched in May, with over a 100 Kickstarter campaigns successful. However, we see that May had also many campaigns canceled; but because the distance between those two points, the ratio of successful:failed campaings is big, meaning that we'll have a big opportunity of having a successful crowdfunding -specially- for theater plays if we launch them in May.
